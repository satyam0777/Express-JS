# 01. Introduction to Express.js

## What is Express.js?

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of creating server-side applications with Node.js by providing a higher-level API for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more.

---

## Why Use Express.js?

- **Simplicity:** Reduces boilerplate code needed to create servers in Node.js.
- **Routing:** Built-in routing system for handling different HTTP methods and URLs.
- **Middleware Support:** Easily add functionality like logging, authentication, and error handling.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for both small and large-scale applications.
- **Community & Ecosystem:** Large number of middleware and plugins available.

---

## How Does Express.js Work?

Express.js sits on top of Node.jsâ€™s HTTP module. It listens for HTTP requests, processes them using middleware and route handlers, and sends responses back to the client.

**Basic Flow:**
1. Client sends an HTTP request.
2. Express receives the request.
3. Middleware functions process the request (e.g., logging, parsing).
4. Route handler sends a response.

## Real-World Use Cases

- RESTful APIs (e.g., for mobile apps)
- Single Page Applications (SPAs) backend
- Server-side rendering for web apps
- Proxies and gateways (API Gateway)
- Microservices

---

## Simple Example

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

## Key Features

- **Routing:** Handle different HTTP methods and URLs.
- **Middleware:** Functions that execute during the request-response cycle.
- **Template Engines:** Support for rendering dynamic HTML.
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error management.
- **Serving Static Files:** Easily serve images, CSS, JS, etc.

## Interview Questions

### 1. What is Express.js and why is it used?
**Answer:**  
Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs. It is used because it provides a simple interface for routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities, making server-side development faster and more organized.

---

### 2. How is Express.js different from Node.js?
**Answer:**  
Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server, while Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js to simplify web application development by providing higher-level abstractions for routing, middleware, and more.

---

### 3. What are some real-world applications of Express.js?
**Answer:**  
- RESTful APIs for web/mobile apps
- Backend for single-page applications
- Microservices
- Proxies and API gateways

---

### 4. What are the core features of Express.js?
**Answer:**  
Routing, middleware support, template engine integration, error handling, and static file serving.

---

### 5. Can you explain the request-response cycle in Express.js?
**Answer:**  
When a client sends a request, Express processes it through a series of middleware functions and route handlers, then sends a response back to the client.
