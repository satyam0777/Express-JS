# Express.js Placement Guide
  
I created this guide as part of my learning journey to master Express.js for backend development and technical placements. Each topic is broken down into a separate file, with in-depth explanations, practical code examples, real-world scenarios, and interview-focused questions. I hope this helps you as much as it helped me!
